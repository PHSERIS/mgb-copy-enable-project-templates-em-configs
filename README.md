## Self Service (Auto-enable) External Module

Self service for auto-enabling External Modules from a project template along with the module's configuration setting values.

### How it works
Once enabled on a project, it detects whether the project was created from a project template, and if it was, then it checks if the template currently contains enabled external modules, and if so it assigns their configuration to the project. Then the Self Service module hides itself from the list of enabled modules.

### Getting started
The module doesn't required any configuration at the project level. Its only function it to assign the modules enabled on the project template onto this newly created project. Optionally, The module can be enabled globally so it can automatically enabled modules on projects created from templates.
The auto enabling of projects takes place on the Project Setup page (landing page of creating a project from a project template).
